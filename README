This project contains 5 files:
a) this README
b) 2 sh scripts to load and dump dbases from postgresQL
c) ddw.sql (builds the DICOM Datawarehouse dbase)
d) mirth_ddw.xml (a MIRTH channel to gather and parse DICOM info into the dbase)

To use this sware, the user must independantly install MIRTH Connect (> V2.x), 
postgreSQL (>V9.x), and pgAdmin. Then:

a) for MIRTH, open the MIRTH admin tool and import the channel
b) for postgresql open the pgAdmin tool and create the stub for the "ddw"
	dbase, owner "postgres". Then from the command line run the load 
	script
